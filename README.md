Matlab sound analysis and plotting functions by Teresa Nick

These are Mathworks Matlab functions for use in plotting and analyzing wav files.  

Dependencies:
The Matlab Signal Processing Toolbox is required to run these functions.

Specific functions:

waveditrev.m
This function is used to "cut" wave files to produce forward and reverse stimuli. In the birdsong field, birds' songs are cut to produce stimuli that selectively activate the song system.  Forward stimuli are typically more effective than reverse stimuli.
